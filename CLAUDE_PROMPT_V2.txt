Fix these issues in the AI Usage Optimizer:

## 1. CHART OVERFLOW ISSUES

### PieChart.jsx
- Container size (line 80-81) is hardcoded to size+120, size+40
- External tooltip (line 208-261) positioned at tooltipPosition.x/y can overflow container
- FIX: Add overflow:visible to parent container OR reposition tooltip to stay within bounds
- Ensure tooltip doesn't get clipped when hovering segments near edges

### UsageChart.jsx  
- Tooltip (line 54-66) uses "bottom-full mb-2" which clips at top of container
- Parent TiltCard has overflow:hidden
- FIX: Either change tooltip position to appear below bars, OR add overflow:visible to chart container, OR use a portal for tooltip

## 2. NON-FUNCTIONAL BUTTONS

### DashboardPage.jsx - Fix these:

a) STAT CARDS (line 357-378):
- ArrowUpRight icon suggests clickable but does nothing
- FIX: Either remove the arrow icon OR make cards clickable to show detailed breakdown modal/view

b) "LEARN MORE" on recommendations (line 532-538):
- Shows "Learn more >" but has no onClick
- FIX: Add onClick that either:
  - Opens modal with detailed implementation steps
  - Expands the card to show more info
  - Links to external resource

c) TOP STAT CARDS:
- They look clickable but aren't
- FIX: Add onClick to navigate to detailed view OR show tooltip with more data

## 3. MAKE DATA FULLY DYNAMIC

### Current issues:
- weeklyUsage in UploadPage.jsx (line 302-310) is calculated from fake percentages, not real dates
- recommendations savings are just percentages of total, not real analysis

### FIX in UploadPage.jsx analyzeData():
a) Parse actual dates from CSV (look for "date", "timestamp", "created_at" columns)
b) Group requests by day of week from real dates
c) Calculate actual daily costs from real data
d) Make recommendations smarter:
   - If >50% is one expensive model, recommend cheaper alternative
   - If duplicate queries found, recommend caching
   - Base savings on actual model distribution, not fixed %

## SUMMARY OF CHANGES NEEDED:

Files to modify:
1. PieChart.jsx - Fix tooltip overflow
2. UsageChart.jsx - Fix tooltip clipping  
3. DashboardPage.jsx - Make buttons functional, add click handlers
4. UploadPage.jsx - Parse real dates, calculate real weekly data

Keep existing UI/animations. Only fix functionality.
